        We just sent an e-mail to the e-mail you provided to us. I know, it's really inconvenient, but by doing this, you're helping us fight against those nasty spammers that we come across so often! Oh gosh, you wouldn't even believe some of the fake e-mail signups we've gotten.
        <br>
        <br>
        Oh yeah, and this also makes sure that you typed in the correct e-mail. You can thank us later.
        <br>
        <br>
        If you don't see the e-mail within the next 5-10 minutes, it may be caught in your spam filter. Talk about irony...
        <br>
        <br>
        Thanks for doing this. If you took the time to read this, then you must really love us. We will be sure to make sure you continue loving us.
